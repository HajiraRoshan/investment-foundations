* The PPC curve model explains the trade-off and how optimal we can spend our resources inorder to be benefitted. Example is trade-off between catching rabbits and berries.
* Moving to bigger classroom could be trade-off of some or coconuts vs catching the fish in castaway movie The curve example is:![Imgur Image](https://i.imgur.com/2QnyqHQ.png) 
* It is all about finding the efficiency, whats is impossible & feasibility is the prime goal of PPC or PPF.
* **Oppurtunity costs** is cost of losing instead to pursuing an another possible opputunity.i.e a value of next best oppurtunity to any decision you make. You can watch TV or spend time reading Books
* **Efficiency**: A full use of the resources in the production and the point is within the PPC. 
* **Inefficient** is  a point which is represented in the interior and the resources(land, labour, capital and entrepreneuship) is not completely utilizied. 
* **Growth** is shift in the bow shaped curve outwards by taking additional resources. 
 * *Pulling off*: companies growing without taking addtional capital like FAAMG are great
* Increasing oppurtunity costs: Where the oppurtunity costs of the good increases as the output of the good or services increases.
