* **Einstellung effect** a thought or old thought just becuase we are too focused on one particular way and it is blocking to thinking other way. This could be for me a analoges thinking 
where I jump right away with my tools and technique known to me. STOP and think first on anything and then try again.

* working memory can hold only 4 items and to move the item from working memory to long term memory you need **spaced repetetions**
* **Chunk** the small pieces which(the above 4 items in working memory) gives menaning to something big concept.Like **How economic machine works** where R.Dalio explains about the three takeaways like: longterm debt cycle, 
short-term debt cycle and productivity. or Ben Graham books on intelligent investor key ideas. 
* Chunking is the process to see top-down and bottom-up approach. To built them **Focus, get key idea, recall the material**
* Lady luck favours one who tries and recall in one best ways to absorb the material 
* **space repetation** & **Interleaving** trying different ways to solve the problem like inverted thinking to solve complex problems
