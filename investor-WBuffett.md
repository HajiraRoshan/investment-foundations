## May 2 Annual Shareholder meeting 2020

* At BRK's virtual annual meeting on May 2, Warren Buffett told shareholders that he had not been a significant buyer of BRK or other stocks (yet) despite 
the major decline in the market. He explained that the range of possible outcomes of the pandemic was too wide for him to confidently make bold investment moves. 
He said that it would take time to understand how fundamental changes in human behavior would affect business values. 
His take was that recovery would not be immediate and that there would be ample opportunities for him to deploy his cash reserves (over $50 per equivalent Class B share as of 3/31) before the crisis was over.

## Intrinsic value BRK ~225 Euros:
In our estimation, BRK's business value is at least $230 per B share (28% higher than its current price) and 
we also think that it will grow at an average rate of at least 7% over the next several years. This is not “moonshot” material, but 7% growth and some narrowing of the discount between stock price and
business value should look very good over the next few years
