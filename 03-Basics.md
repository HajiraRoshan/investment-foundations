## Notion of scarcity

* Economics is by and large study of scarce resources and how well we allocate them. Scarce resource: fish eggs vs Free resources: Air(o2) in our planet

## Four factors of production

* Land,labour,capital and Entrepreneurship
  * capital -> a tool that produce things. Eg. a factory produces tools which can be used to produce other end products.*Capital Goods* are one of them. COntrasting thought is the consumer
  goods which depletes soon(on consumer end)
  * Pulling off : "Donald Yacktman" the capital goods are high capital intensive eg. John deere - lifecycle is 17 years vs somebody who makes toothpaste. Airlines businesss took $1 to generate
  40cents
  * Entrepreneurship -> one who ties all the other factors.
  
## Normative and positive statement

* Normative is matter of opnion or moral which **cant be tested** and prespective
* Positive is fact **testable** and descriptive
* Eg. Government should raise minimum wage an Normative, Increase tax on wealthy is positive.

## Economic Models:

* Similar to field within the chemistry where we pin point and right the equation *pv = nRT* is just simplication of the behaviour of the gas. Thats the gas model as framework
* Take the example biology, the Human as complex as he is can be modeled or mapped to mouse or fruit fly to be experimented with and thats how we seee mouse model.
* In Economics, we will see the supply-demand model, in finance we'll see the CAPM and other comparable model to do DCF or valuation.
