# Guy Spier

* the most interesting aspect of guy is just sitting with the stock or holding for longer periods like roughly about 7 years
* Case study on FCA and Ferrari. 
  * He bought the stock on 2014 for about 12 Euros about 2 milliion shares = 22 million
  * Now at 2020 six years he sold around 60% at 1.3 milliion share at at 10 Euros= 13 million and another inttrinsic value of FCA riht now 15 * 0.7 million= 5 million -> net he lost 
    about 3 million 13+5= 18 million - 22 million = 3 million
  * However, there is a child how added 10x of this loss, he is called **Ferrari**.. he got 10:1 stock split and gained 200,000 shares at 2016 and kept till 2020 for about 170 Euros 
    a share, which is about 170 * 200,000 = 34 million right now and he dumped 60% about 130,000 `170 = 22 million.  
  * Net gain of FCA investing 22 million right now is = 13 millon + 22 mil = 35 mil + 20 (intrinsic value of 40% of FCA is 5 million +  & Ferri is 15 mill) ) =  55-60 million
  * **Its like 3-4X deal plus dividends paid and expected merger waiting**
