## Specialization:

* **Specialization**  is the safest way up for most people. For that reason, surgeons know more and more about less and less. That's what gets rewarded. 
If you have a nasty fistula in your colon, you do not want a surgeon who's good at Proust or political science.


## Mental Tricks:

* **I invert all the time** or turn problems upside down. As an Air Force meteorologist during World War II, he didn't ask what would keep pilots safe.
Instead, he recalled, he asked what would kill them. That led him to focus all his efforts on trying to predict snow, ice or fog—and to ignore pretty much everything else

*  **Learning** "I haven't done any calculous since I left Cal Tech. It is  completely gone." He said he uses uses **Arithmetic and common sense**.

* **Think in multiple dimensions**. Mr. Munger told how he more than doubled the appraisal of a client's property by realizing that it wasn't just the static acreage of the land that contributed its value, but also its changes in altitude.

* **Destroy your own best-loved ideas** Instead of being afraid of changing your mind, you should always be open to admitting that you were wrong—and celebrate it, since you have learned something important.
