## From output based:


* The coparative advanatage makes to push the PPC from the classical bow shaped and it increses the productivity
* Even though a country A or B can definetly have the absolute advantage but with comparative advantage they can still benefit 
* Example:
  * Lets say two country has the PPC is bow shaped and first take the *max of the curve* i.e what it can produce
  * Plot the table between max for A and B
  * Now find the Oppurtunity cost for the goods -> in terms of the marginal costs
  * Now, given the OC and PPC *trade* and find the best optimal PPC shift
* Eg. in the diagram

## From Input advantage:

* starting from how much a worker can produce and move on further

## When there is no trade

* At the end the OC is nothing but the slope of any two goods and services that company A and B could produce 
* The trade makes sense if the slope is different and it addds value or beneficial.

## Specialization:

* In order for Canadians to benefit from trade with Mexico, they must be able to **import** avocados at a lower opportunity cost than it would cost them to grow domestically. Likewise, Mexico must get maple syrup more cheaply (in terms of avocados given up) than it could have produced it for domestically. The terms of trade refer to the trading price agreed upon by two agents, which when beneficial, will allow both countries to enjoy gains from trade.
* **Pulling off**: M.Pabrai such way India is poor for stupid reasons, export for Sugar industry in UP and the regulations made it hard to specialize. Again , POSCO example they try to tap 
the useless iron ore from India due to its stupidity lost it specilization and poor
* Suadi specilized in petroluem and rich and US rich in soy bean production and staying rich
* **Pulling off** : C.Munger for induvidual specialization is always best than "Jack of all" 

## Practise:
* **ONE CANNNOT HAVE COMP: ADVANATGE ON BOTH GOODS** so then neither is comprable
