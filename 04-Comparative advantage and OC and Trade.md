## From output based:


* The coparative advanatage makes to push the PPC from the classical bow shaped and it increses the productivity
* Even though a country A or B can definetly have the absolute advantage but with comparative advantage they can still benefit 
* Example:
  * Lets say two country has the PPC is bow shaped and first take the *max of the curve* i.e what it can produce
  * Plot the table between max for A and B
  * Now find the Oppurtunity cost for the goods -> in terms of the marginal costs
  * Now, given the OC and PPC *trade* and find the best optimal PPC shift
* Eg. in the diagram
